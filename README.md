## Earthquake Zen Garden

Hi! I'm your first Markdown file in **StackEdit**. If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me. Once you have finished with me, you can create new files by opening the **file explorer** on the left corner of the navigation bar.


# Features

This App is created using the react router for three different views. It has a header with a logo (link back to home), and a link to a profile detail view. Each entry in the table links to a detail view of that particular record.

## Implemented Features

 - Clicking the logo in the header from any view will return to the Home view.
 - Clicking on one of the items in the list will take the user to the Detail View of the item.
 - Clicking the welcome message in the header will take the user to the Profile View.
 - Clicking the column header successively toggles the sort direction according to that column.

## Run the App

- Clone the repo using the Github clone link.
- Run the following commands:
 - cd earthquake-zen-garden
 - npm install
 - npm start
